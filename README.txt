Compile Instructions:
	$ cd POSIX-Threads

List of significant design decisions:
	Upon creation of the threads, the user and OS created thread ID are both printed on the console
	and then to the QUOTE.txt file with it's quote depending on whether the user created thread ID
	is even or odd.   

List of extra features:
	Prints both user and OS made thread IDs.
	
Lessons learned:
	Learned how to create and manage multiple threads and using the semaphore to control
	this. Learned the basics of POSIX threads programming in C/C++.
